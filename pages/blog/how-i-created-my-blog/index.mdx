# How I created my blog and which decisions did I take

<br />
Hello there...
<br />
<p>
  First of all welcome to my blog and to my first Blog Post. In this article I
  am going to explain how I created this blog and why I decided to do it.
</p>
<p>
  I've been thinking about creating a blog since a long time already but
  everytime I wanted to progress on it, I ended up watching netflix for hours.
  "Procrastination at it's finest".
  <br />
  Okey, let's cut to the chase!
</p>

## Why creating my own blog

<p>
  I wanted to start blogging since quite some time. I wanted to share my
  thoughts, ideas and also share tips and tricks about several subjects. The
  subjects that I will be blogging about will go from technical tutorials, to
  travel and trips blog posts, to ideas about productivity and how to manage a
  community (I am the founder of{' '}
  <a href="https://bejs.io">BeJS: A JavaScript community in Belgium</a>) and
  anything that will cross my mind and that I will think someone out there can
  relate to.
</p>
<p>
  But why did I need to create my own blog? why not use dev.to, medium or the
  hundreds of different alternatives out there. <br />
  Well I was hesitant at first! But then I signed up for monica's lent newsletter
  and got convinced to start publishing on my own domain.
</p>
<p>
  The main advantage of publishing on your own domain is that you control it and
  you own it. It is just you and your content, no one else. You can do whatever
  you want with it. Isn't that freedom at it's best? Also, if you're creating
  content for another platform, they can change their algorithm, lose their
  funding, suspend your account or whatever they like.
</p>
<p>
  Second reason is that you will be able to create a mailing list and an
  audience (You will be able to use this later on for launching your products,
  or anything you like)
</p>
<p>
  You learn new technologies, test others, and if you don't procrastinating you
  get to have a lot of fun while implementing it.
</p>
<p>
  If you are new to coding and need to show up your skills you can use it as a
  code sample. Be creative, show off your technical skills and share that code
  with recruiters
</p>
<p>
  There is probably way more reasons for creating your own blog, so do not
  hesitate to tell me what convinced you create your own blog!
  <br />
  Now enough with the why, let's get to the how
</p>

## Choosing the tech stack

### NextJS vs Gatsby

<p>
  Being a fan of React I wanted to use React to build my blog this narrowed the
  possibilities to the two big names when it comes to SSG: (static site
  generation). Gatsby Vs NextJS!
</p>
<p>
  I've been using gatsby for quite some time now, ({' '}
  <a href="https://www.b2asolutions.com/">my company's website</a> and{' '}
  <a href="https://www.bejs.io/">BeJS.io</a> website use gatsby) and I think it
  is a great tool and the ready to use plugins provided by the community make it
  so easy to bootstrap a blog in few seconds. However I've been founding it
  quite slow lately and I wanted to learn something new! I was also looking to
  learn NextJS because I am super hyped about{' '}
  <a href="https://blitzjs.com/">Blitz.js</a> the new React framework and It is
  built on top of Next. I think it will be an amazing framework and I would like
  to contribute to it in the future so I need to learn Next!
</p>
<span>
  TODO (NOTE component) NOTE: From what I understood the blitz.js team will fork
  nextjs as their customizations are becoming pretty big so we need to keep an
  eye on that.
</span>

### TailwindCSS vs CSS in JS!

<p>
  well why not both! So I've been thinking about whether to use CSS in JS or
  tailwindCSS which became quite trendy lately and I could not decide! Luckily,
  on that late night I receive an email from{' '}
  <a href="https://twitter.com/mxstbr">Max stoiber</a> the creator of a CSS in
  JS library called styled-components. In that newsletter he talked about{' '}
  <a href="https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro">twin.macro</a>... A new
  CSS in JS library that came out and that support tailwindCSS. You can find the
  article <a href="https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/tailwind/">here</a>
</p>
<p>
  I was quickly convinced and decided to give twin.macro a try and It has been
  great. With tailwind it's very easy to progress and create nice designs.
</p>

### CMS vs MDX

<p>
  For those who do not know <a href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</a>: It is
  "Markdown for the component era" as they explain it themselves. It basically
  allows us to use markdown and jsx at the same time! we use it in my job for
  documentation with storybook and it's pretty easy to use and setup. <br />
  With the abundance of gatsby plugins provided for headless CMSs (wordpress, contentful...)
  it would be easy to use a CMS to create content for my blog. <br />
  Being a developer, I like my IDE and don't like leaving it for too long
  (unless it's to watch dumb netflix shows) So I decided to use MDX.
</p>

## Conclusion

<p>
  Another benefit of having your own blog: You discover your weaknesses! While
  developing this blog I fell horrible when working with CSS. I was hesitant
  about everything, fighting with it, and searching on google every two seconds.
  So I decided to buy{' '}
  <a href="https://twitter.com/joshwcomeau">Joshua Comeau</a>'s course:{' '}
  <a href="https://css-for-js.dev/">CSS for JS devs</a>
  and the plan is to redesign my blog once I finish that course! It does not matter
  what technology you use for your blog as long as you do it. Don't get me wrong!
  You don't have to start a blog if you don't like it: Some of the best developers
  I know don't have a blog. All I'm trying to say is that it is a proven way of progression
  on your career, and also on other levels as explained above. If you already have
  a blog, I am curious to know what technology you used and why you decided to create
  your own blog! Come talk to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/Aymen_Ben_Amor">
