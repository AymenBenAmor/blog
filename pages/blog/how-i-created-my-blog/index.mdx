<FunkyWord>Hello there...</FunkyWord>
<br />
<Paragraph>
  First of all welcome to my blog and to my first Blog Post. In this article I
  am going to explain how I created this blog and why I decided to do it.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  I've been thinking about creating a blog since a long time already but
  everytime I wanted to progress on it, I ended up watching netflix for hours:{' '}
  {` `}
  <FunkyWord>"Procrastination at it's finest".</FunkyWord> Okey, let's cut to the
  chase!
</Paragraph>

<Heading tag="h2"> Why creating my own blog</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  I wanted to start blogging since quite some time. I wanted to share my
  thoughts, ideas and also share tips and tricks about several subjects. The
  subjects that I will be blogging about will go from technical tutorials, to
  travel and trips blog posts, to ideas about productivity and how to manage a
  community (I am the founder of{' '}
  <BeautifulLink target="_blank" href="https://bejs.io">
    BeJS: A JavaScript community in Belgium
  </BeautifulLink>
  ) and anything that will cross my mind and that I will think someone out there
  can relate to.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  But why did I need to create my own blog? why not use dev.to, medium or the
  hundreds of different alternatives out there. <br />
  Well I was hesitant at first! But then I signed up for monica's lent newsletter
  and got convinced to start publishing on my own domain.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  The main advantage of publishing on your own domain is that you control it and
  you own it. It is just you and your content, no one else. You can do whatever
  you want with it. Isn't that freedom at it's best? Also, if you're creating
  content for another platform, they can change their algorithm, lose their
  funding, suspend your account or whatever they like.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  Second reason is that you will be able to create a mailing list and an
  audience (You will be able to use this later on for launching your products,
  or anything you like)
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  You learn new technologies, test others, and if you don't procrastinating you
  get to have a lot of fun while implementing it.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  If you are new to coding and need to show up your skills you can use it as a
  code sample. Be creative, show off your technical skills and share that code
  with recruiters
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  There is probably way more reasons for creating your own blog, so do not
  hesitate to tell me what convinced you create your own blog!
  <br />
  Now enough with the why, let's get to the how
</Paragraph>

<Heading tag="h2">Choosing the tech stack</Heading>

<Heading tag="h3">NextJS vs Gatsby</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  Being a fan of React I wanted to use React to build my blog this narrowed the
  possibilities to the two big names when it comes to SSG: (static site
  generation). Gatsby Vs NextJS!
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  I've been using gatsby for quite some time now, ({' '}
  <BeautifulLink target="_blank" href="https://www.b2asolutions.com/">
    my company's website
  </BeautifulLink>{' '}
  and{' '}
  <BeautifulLink target="_blank" href="https://www.bejs.io/">
    BeJS.io
  </BeautifulLink>{' '}
  website use gatsby) and I think it is a great tool and the ready to use
  plugins provided by the community make it so easy to bootstrap a blog in few
  seconds. However I've been founding it quite slow lately and I wanted to learn
  something new! I was also looking to learn NextJS because I am super hyped
  about{' '}
  <BeautifulLink target="_blank" href="https://blitzjs.com/">
    Blitz.js
  </BeautifulLink>{' '}
  the new React framework and It is built on top of Next. I think it will be an
  amazing framework and I would like to contribute to it in the future so I need
  to learn Next!
</Paragraph>
<Note>
  NOTE: From what I understood the blitz.js team will fork nextjs as their
  customizations are becoming pretty big so we need to keep an eye on that.
</Note>

<Heading tag="h3">TailwindCSS vs CSS in JS!</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  well why not both! So I've been thinking about whether to use CSS in JS or
  tailwindCSS which became quite trendy lately and I could not decide! Luckily,
  on that late night I receive an email from{' '}
  <BeautifulLink target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/mxstbr">
    Max stoiber
  </BeautifulLink>{' '}
  the creator of a CSS in JS library called styled-components. In that
  newsletter he talked about{' '}
  <BeautifulLink
    target="_blank"
    href="https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro"
  >
    twin.macro
  </BeautifulLink>
  ... A new CSS in JS library that came out and that support tailwindCSS. You can
  find the article <BeautifulLink
    target="_blank"
    href="https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/tailwind/"
  >
    here
  </BeautifulLink>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  I was quickly convinced and decided to give twin.macro a try and It has been
  great. With tailwind it's very easy to progress and create nice designs.
</Paragraph>

<Heading tag="h3">CMS vs MDX</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  For those who do not know{' '}
  <BeautifulLink target="_blank" href="https://mdxjs.com/">
    MDX
  </BeautifulLink>
  : It is "Markdown for the component era" as they explain it themselves. It basically
  allows us to use markdown and jsx at the same time! we use it in my job for documentation
  with storybook and it's pretty easy to use and setup. <br />
  With the abundance of gatsby plugins provided for headless CMSs (wordpress,
  contentful...) it would be easy to use a CMS to create content for my blog.{' '}
  <br />
  Being a developer, I like my IDE and don't like leaving it for too long (unless
  it's to watch dumb netflix shows) So I decided to use MDX.
</Paragraph>

<Heading tag="h2"> Conclusion</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  Another benefit of having your own blog: You discover your weaknesses! While
  developing this blog I felt horrible when trying to create a design and later
  trying to convert it to CSS. I was hesitant about everything, fighting with
  it, and searching on google every two seconds. So I decided to buy{' '}
  <BeautifulLink target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/joshwcomeau">
    Joshua Comeau
  </BeautifulLink>
  's course: <BeautifulLink target="_blank" href="https://css-for-js.dev/">
    CSS for JS devs
  </BeautifulLink> and a book called: <BeautifulLink
    target="_blank"
    href="https://www.refactoringui.com/book"
  >
    Refactoring UI
  </BeautifulLink>. The plan is to redesign my blog once I finish those!
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  It does not matter what technology you use for your blog as long as you do it.
  Don't get me wrong! You don't have to start a blog if you don't like it: Some
  of the best developers I know don't have a blog. All I'm trying to say is that
  it is a proven way of progression on your career, and also on other levels as
  explained above.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  If you already have a blog, I am curious to know what technology you used and
  why you decided to create your own blog! Come talk to me on{' '}
