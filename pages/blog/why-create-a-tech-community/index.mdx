  You should probably get involved in your local dev community, or even better:

  The year is 2019! I am in one of the best conferences in Europe:{' '}

</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  Now, to be honest, Building a tech community was an idea that I was thinking
  about for quite some time already... But I could not find the courage to do
  it. I mean when you think of it: there is so much stuff to manage if you want
  to create a community... How are you going to get speakers? How are you going
  to motivate people to come to your meetups? Who's going to pay for drinks? How
  to manage the big difference in people's expertise? and knowledge? so many
  questions and I did not know where to start but hey let's start with the why?
  and we will see the how, later!
</Paragraph>

<Heading tag="h2"> Why getting involved in your local tech community?</Heading>
<Heading tag="h3"> A community helps you grow and improve yourself </Heading>
<Paragraph>
  When you like coding, it is very easy to stick to your IDE and spend your
  entire time writing code. The problem is that if you want to progress quickly
  in your career, you have to know that only 25% of what companies look for in
  senior developers is technical skills... 75% is about soft skills and your
  impact on the business. Public speaking, Management skills, Leadership skills
  and many more are skills that you will need if you want to grow as a
  developer!
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  Being involved in a community helps your progress in these soft skills.. You
  learn a lot from organising events:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Marketing skills: </b>
      when you start a community, you need to look for ways to attract people, so
      you learn marketing techniques... You start using different social medias and
      platforms to bring people to your events. You experiment, try a lot of different
      tactics to finally find the right one for your community.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Presentation and communication skills: </b>
      Talking at a meetup, even for presenting the speaker is quite a challenge...
      You have to make people excited about what's going to happen. If there are
      delays, you need to find a way to entertain people while they are waiting.
      This is all valuable for you as a person (not only as a developer). Also, reaching
      out to speakers helps improve your communication skills.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Negotiations skills: </b>
      Fortunately for us, the IT sector is booming.. People make a lot of money just
      by finding developers to hire. Companies are always looking for great developers.
      So when you start a tech community there are big chances that you will be contacted
      by few companies to collaborate. You will have to use your negotiation skills,
      and find ways of making the community profit from these partnerships without
      your community becoming a market place for devs and your members being harassed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Leadership and management skills: </b>
      When organizing events you will have to work with contractors, sponsors, volunteers,
      other members of the community and so on. This can improve your skills in people
      management and make you a better leader.
    </li>
  </ul>
</Paragraph>
<Heading tag="h3"> Networking </Heading>
<Paragraph>
  I cannot stress how important it is to have a good network in your life. When
  you get involved in a community you get access to hundreds, sometimes
  thousands of people that work in the same sector as you. This is an amazing
  opportunity: You get to know the market in your local area, what technologies,
  methodologies are used? What are the current rates, salaries for developers?
  What technologies your should invest time in? You get to know all of this
  information. Having a network like this can also help you meet friends...
  (I've personally met amazing people in BeJS meetups and some of them became
  friends!). You can meet business partners, investors, companies, mentors,
  speakers and so on... A network like this is an outstanding resource!
</Paragraph>
<Heading tag="h3"> A great motivation for learning </Heading>
<Paragraph>
  When being involved in a community, there is a lot of work to do... This means
  that there is room for tools creation. Websites, scripts, apps and other kind
  of projects that can help you manage the community. All of these are
  opportunities for you to show off your skills, to learn new technologies. (I
  learnt Gatsby, NextJS, GraphQL because I created tools for BeJS using these
  technologies). You get to learn to use different tools for marketing and
  managing campaigns on social networks.
</Paragraph>
<Heading tag="h3"> Fighting your shyness </Heading>
<Paragraph>
  It might not look like it, but I am a very shy person. I am the kind of person
  that almost never talks to someone he does not know. I mean: Calling for a
  doctor appointment on the phone used to be quite difficult to do for me. I
  always had a feeling of annoying people when talking to them. By starting
  BeJS, I had to contact sponsors, speakers, partners, contractors and other
  members and it helped me a lot to overcome my shyness. I, now, don't think
  twice before sending a message to a speaker, or to a company asking for
  sponsorship. It does not mean that I get a reply every time, but I usually do
  and if I don't get a reply, so be it at least I've done my part.
</Paragraph>
<Heading tag="h2"> The challenges </Heading>
<Heading tag="h3"> Finding a sponsor </Heading>
<Paragraph>
  As you might think, finding a sponsor for your events might be quite a
  challenge. You need at least a venue for your events! You need food and drinks
  to attract people.{' '}
  <FunkyWord>
    Trust me, I cannot stress how important food is for attracting people to
    your events!{' '}
  </FunkyWord>
  Start with your network... If you're working within a company, ask your manager
  or your HR team, They might be interested. If you're a freelancer or contractor,
  ask your clients, or the consulting companies you work with. If they already have
  a place, it is not a big deal for them to let you use it once per month! It is
  an opportunity for them as well as it gives them visibility and they can use these
  events for hiring. Just be sure to be clear on the collaboration so that they don't
  start harassing your members.
</Paragraph>
<Heading tag="h3"> Finding speakers </Heading>
<Paragraph>
  This is the most important part of the meetup: I mean why would people go to a
  meetup if there is no interesting subject. There is no magic trick here: Ask
  people! For your first events, do not hesitate to contact anyone you know and
  ask if they will be interested in speaking. Motivate them, push them and help
  them if needed. Again it is your right to contact any person you want,
  however, you're not entitled to an answer! So if they don't respond just move
  on. The popular speakers out there receive hundreds or thousands of DMs so
  they can't answer to everyone.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
  Publish a Call for paper on your website. Even if someone contacts you for a
  talk and you're full for the next few months, It's always good to have a plan
  B or you can always contact them later when no one is scheduled
</Paragraph>
<Heading tag="h3"> Attracting attendees </Heading>
<Paragraph>
  Well... I'm going to be completely honest on this one! Food and drinks are
  your best shot at attracting more attendees! It is nice to go to meetups to
  listen to a talk, but it is nicer if you can listen to the talk with a beer in
  your hand and your stomach full, right? Ads on social networks can also help
  significantly to spread the word! The best social networks to use may be
  different from one country to another, but for us: linkedIn and meetup are the
  most promising! Last but not least: Believe in your community! I remember when
  I asked for the venue from our sponsor for the first event. I said:{' '}
  <FunkyWord>
    We're going to be 5 or so people so all we need is a table!
  </FunkyWord>
  Two days later, I create the event on meetup and 50 people subscribed in less than
  48 hours!!! I was lucky my sponsors had a big room that could fit everyone but
  I learnt to always define a maximum amount of people.
</Paragraph>
<Heading tag="h3">
  {' '}
  Managing the difference in knowledge and experience!{' '}
</Heading>
<Paragraph>
  In your community, you will get people that have been working in their field
  for 10 years, but you will also get students, or even people that are just
  thinking about a career change. Therefore, it might be difficult to find
  subjects that are interesting to everyone. My advice for this is to try to
  diversify the talks you accept! Different technologies, different kinds of
  talks (soft skills talks, technical talks, workshops, coding competitions,
  Talks about personal experiences) By diversifying your talks, you attract more
  attendees, and make your meetups interesting for everyone!
</Paragraph>
<Heading tag="h3"> Finding time </Heading>
<Paragraph>
  Being involved in the community is very time consuming. Meetup which is the go
  to tool for creating groups is not really a great tool (In my opinion). You
  lose a lot of time, sending messages, creating posts, announcing your event,
  reminding people about the event so that they show up, asking for feedback to
  improve your events, contacting speakers, managing partners and sponsors,
  Creating websites, and tools, creating marketing content, etc. You add a
  40h/week job next to that and people start asking if you have time to sleep
  between all of that. The solution:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Create tools and frameworks: </b> To help you automate all of the
      repetitive tasks, create tools and put processes in place so that it
      becomes a habit. For example, I created a script to update our website
      when I publish a new event on meetup. I asked a friend to create a graphic
      I can reuse for every event announcement
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Delegate: </b>Find people that can help you! If you don't have
      volunteers to help? fiverr is an amazing platform to get stuff done for a
      good price!
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Learn to say no: </b> If something is not going to benefit your
      community, say no directly. Don't do something just because you're afraid
      of saying no! It is a waste of time for you and the other person as well!
    </li>
  </ul>
</Paragraph>
<Heading tag="h2"> Conclusion </Heading>
<Paragraph>
  I created the BeJS community almost 2 years ago, and I think it's one of the
  biggest achievements I ever made. I learnt so much... It made me happy (when
  an event is a success!), it made me angry (when meetup was down at the exact
  moment our event is scheduled and almost no one is able to get the link to the
  zoom meeting! or when some spammers joined the zoom meeting and started doing
  crazy shit in the chat and in the videos), it made me sad (when 45 people
  subscribed but only 8 showed up!). I met amazing people, Companies contact me
  every now and then for partnerships and sponsorships. I got to know the
  projects of the developers based in Belgium.
